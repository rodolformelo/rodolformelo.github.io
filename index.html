          <h3>Shell Company Detection using GNN</h3>
          <p><strong> Master of Science Thesis</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong> Abstract</strong> Identifying shell companies in the Brazilian Value Added Tax system is complex. They exploit the lack of communication between tax authorities to engage in illegal tax practices. Numerous methodologies have been developed to identify banking, insurance, and social security fraud. However, few works apply to tax hoaxes, particularly in the Brazilian context. Motivated by this gap, we developed an approach for identifying shell companies. It consists in selecting adequate company features and applying recent Graph Neural Network architectures. We tested different approaches to connect companies and train the model. They all indicated promising results. Our most satisfactory model applied a modified Graph Attention Networks, built using connections among companies with the same owners, accountants, or directors. Real data showed a 14.7% performance increase when using graph information. The method has also proven robust enough to generalize to future data.</li>

          <p><strong> Logo Detection using Tensorflow (2) Object Detection API</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>In social media analysis, sometimes images/videos can inform us more than the pure text. For example, if you want to do a search on users of a certain brand, it is perhaps more effective to look for images/videos, as it is unlikely that anyone will explicitly write the company in their post. Therefore, combined with textual analyses, this methodology can improve the result of such analyses.</li>
            <li>Model trainned with the dataset used for training was scrapped from public publications on instagran between 2015 and 2017 in some US cities. The logos used for training are: Nike, Adidas, Under Armour, Puma, The North Face, Starbucks, Apple Inc., Mercedes-Benz, NFL, Coca-Cola, Chanel, Toyota, Pepsi, Hard Rock Cafè.</li>
